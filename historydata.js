The mighty old-growth trees of New Hampshire's forests were prized by the English Crown for their use as ships masts. Many of the first settlers came to New Hampshire, not in search of religious freedom but rather to seek their fortunes through trade with England, primarily in fish, fur, and timber.",

    cardText: 'The Timothy Waterhouse House, sometimes known as the <strong>Waterhouse-Ham House</strong>, is located at 273 Maplewood Avenue, on the northwest corner of Maplewood Avenue and Dearborn Street.  \
    Timothy Waterhouse, a Portsmouth native employed as a tanner and shoemaker, was born in 1675. He built this home around 1700; however, its original location was about a half mile north on Freeman’s Point. At that time, the headland was named Ham’s Point for the original owner, William Ham. Timothy married Ruth Moses in January \
    1700, and the Waterhouses had eleven children together. In 1725, there were nine rambunctious children living in this small home (six girls and three boys), from ages four to \
    seventeen. There’s a local story about the time the kids were home alone, enjoying a rowdy evening in the absence of their parents. They could make all the noise they wanted, because the house was isolated, and there \
    was a snowstorm blowing outside. Suddenly, there was a loud knocking at the door! All of the siblings abruptly hushed themselves: Margaret, Mary, Ruth, Joseph, Timothy, Sarah, Elizabeth, John, and Lydia. The bravest and \
    oldest, Margaret, must have been apprehensive as she walked to the door and swung it open. In the dark doorway stood an apparition dressed all in white, with a black face. Thinking The Devil himself had come calling, \
    Margaret immediately fainted. The visitor proved to be an African slave owned by another tanner, Nathaniel Jackson, who had been sent to retrieve Mr. Jackson’s shoes – possibly a new pair crafted by their father. The Timothy Waterhouse House moved to its present location on Maplewood Avenue around 1765 and remains a private residence.',
