            tell a story from the perspective of a body of water - the <strong>North Mill Pond</strong>. Imagine the

        <p class="card-text">When the first Europeans arrived early in the 17th Century, North Mill Pond was a tidal
          inlet off the Piscataqua River with thickly wooded shores. The mighty old-growth trees of New Hampshire's
          forests were prized by the English Crown for their use as ships masts. Many of the first settlers came to New
          Hampshire, not in search of religious freedom but rather to seek their fortunes through trade with England,
          primarily in fish, fur, and timber.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Timothy Waterhouse House, sometimes known as the <strong>Waterhouse-Ham House</strong>,
          is located at
          273 Maplewood Avenue, on the northwest corner of Maplewood Avenue and Dearborn Street. Timothy Waterhouse, a
          Portsmouth native employed as a tanner and shoemaker, was born in 1675. He built this
          home around 1700; however, its original location was about a half-mile north on Freeman’s Point. At that time,
          the headland was named Ham’s Point for the original owner, William Ham. Timothy married Ruth Moses in January
          1700, and the Waterhouses had eleven children together. In 1725, there
          were nine rambunctious children living in this small home (six girls and three boys), from ages four to
          seventeen. There’s a local story about the time the kids were home alone, enjoying a rowdy evening in the
          absence of their parents. They could make all the noise they wanted, because the house was isolated, and there
          was a snowstorm blowing outside. Suddenly, there was a loud knocking at the door! All of the siblings abruptly
          hushed themselves: Margaret, Mary, Ruth, Joseph, Timothy, Sarah, Elizabeth, John, and Lydia. The bravest and
          oldest, Margaret, must have been apprehensive as she walked to the door and swung it open. In the dark doorway
          stood an apparition dressed all in white, with a black face. Thinking The Devil himself had come calling,
          Margaret immediately fainted. The visitor proved to be an African slave owned by another tanner, Nathaniel
          Jackson, who had been sent to retrieve Mr. Jackson’s shoes – possibly a new pair crafted by their father. The
          Timothy Waterhouse House moved to its present location on Maplewood Avenue around 1765 and remains a private
          residence.</p>

          of <strong>the Rockingham Steam Factory</strong>. Some 220 men, women, girls, and boys eventually found
          employment at this company, working directly at the factory or from their home as “seamers and finishers.”
          Up to 1,200 pairs of stockings could be manufactured per week. </p>
