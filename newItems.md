Christian Shore Known in the 17th Century as the Fresh Creek area, the land across NMP was first laid out after the great land division of 1660.

According to local tradition, in the 18th century "when there were but few families beyond the north mill bridge, some of these yeomen and artisans were sid to be strict adherents to puritan principles therefore named it christian shores. Other's more loose int heir habits frequented Foss Tavern across the creek on the North End, and after drinking a socializing, would joke "Well, we must leave for Christian Shore" sarcastic refernec to their neighbors.

The north Mill Pond's fresh water creek was used for water powered saw milling in the 1600's It's mouth was dammed in 1764 for use as another tidal grist mill

shipbuilding goes back to the wars between the British and the French in the 1740s. New England’s contribution to the successful siege of Louisbourg in 1745 led to a commission to build two Royal Navy vessels, including a 44-gun ship to be called HMS America.
In 1747, the job went to Col. Nathaniel Meserve, who had a shipyard on the banks of the North Mill Pond in Portsmouth.

Nathaniel Meserve (1704–1758) was an American shipbuilder. Meserve was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Clement Maserve and his wife Elizabeth Jones. On December 16, 1725, aged 21, he married Jane Libby and together they had ten children. Nathaniel Meserve would become a shipwright in his native Portsmouth, a hub of early American shipbuilding.

During King George's War Nathaniel was a lieutenant colonel in the New Hampshire Militia regiment at the 1745 capture of Fortress Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. His shipbuilding experience allowed him to build sleds to transport the cannon over the marshy ground. In 1749 he was hired by the Royal Navy to build a 50 gun warship HMS America at his shipyard.

In 1745 England was at war with France. In support of the Motherland, 3,000 New Englanders successfully took over the strategic French fort in Nova Scotia. William Pepperrell of Kittery helped British Gen Peter Warren win the day, which is why their life-sized portraits still hang inside the Portsmouth Athenaeum.

"The British Navy very much liked having their ships built at home because it was big business," Rob Napier says. "They were loathe, I think, to send shipbuilding contracts outside of southern England."

But amazingly, they did exactly that. As a nod to the impressive colonial victory at Louisbourg, Portsmouth was given the contract to build HMS America. Col. Nathaniel Meserve, who had been instrumental to Pepperrell in the victory at Louisbourg, received the commission. 

 Shipbuilders George Boyd and George Raynes continued the North End shipbuilding tradition into the 19th century.

The model of HMS America, however, fared better than the ship. Apparently built from green wood, the warship was a disappointment to the British Navy and no more commissions followed. The real HMS America saw no significant action. 

HMS Boston (1756) was a 44-gun fifth rate launched at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1749 as HMS America and renamed in 1756. The ship was sold in 1757.

After Meserve died of smallpox in the second siege of Louisbourg in 1758, the property was sold in 1764 to the ambitous European Immigrant merchant Peter Livius. Livius also acquired the right to dam the creek for power 'capable of turning 7 or 8 different kinds of works besides 4 grist mills."

In 1771 the estaqte and mills and shipyard were purchased by Beorge Boyd.
The garded was surrounded by a white picket fence and "at intervals... handsomely carved Grenadier;s heads were placed on posts". 

In 1774 the house was expaned. Boyd escaped to England during the Revolution and the gardens were slowly sold off.

eventually mid 1800s George Rayne's bought the House and shipyard.


a small watered powered spinning mill for woolen yarn for hand weaving of hosiery operated on the western end of NMP in the 1830's

Steam powered manufacturing occured on the southern shore of NMP after the railroad was built
to accomodate several railroads the mill pond was partially filled in and an industrial neighborhood evolved around one large cotton limm and several small industries

Ship building Ryanes 1840-1860

by the civil war brewing of ale began to replace the textiel industries. Frank Jones Brewery was america;s largest manufacturer of ale along with smaller Eldrige brewery which replaced the hosiery mill

The brewing industry started to pull pople into the Creek north of NMP becoming a center of Irish settlement

Electric streetcar system establish in 1891

Prohibition killed the breweries
depression hit the city hard

wwII made the shipyard busier

Pease Air Force Base closed in 1990 popoulatin dropped 20%
